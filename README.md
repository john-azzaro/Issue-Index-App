## Project Name
Issue Index 

<br>

## Project Description
Issue Index is an index of open and closed issues encountered during a given project. With **Issue Index**, your team can navigate to a central hub to document any past, current, or even future issues with relative ease. Search by category through documented issues or browse thorough the most recent additions. Not sure about a specific category title? The search will accomodate partial spelling and inclusions. Have an issue that you want to post? Simply click "Add new issue", jot down the title of your issue, the problem and the solution, and/or even drag-and-drop a screen cap of your issue for future reference. You can even edit and delete issues if you want! This is a fully collaborative environment for your team.

## Who is this for?
**Developers** or any team members working on a common project with potentially common issues. This product is for teams that want to keep a lexicon of issues encountered in thier own development and used as a collective repository for solutions to issues encountered in a particular project that could be referenced not only for this project, but for related projects in the future. This issue index would be inviting, simple, streamlined, and useful compared to unwelcoming wiki pages.








## What is the Issue Index Application?

<br>

### What is the problem?
Suppose you are working on a project with a handful of engineers and you come across a problem. The problem (or as the application refers to it as an "issue") could be something complicated like a pesky bug, common errors, or anything in-between. And whether you solve the problem on your own, find a solution on stack overflow, ask a colleague, etc. you eventually find a solution. Unfortunately, in most cases you would most likely think nothing of it beyond it being a solution to the problem at hand and move on.

### Why hasnt the problem been solved?
Although services like github allow users to create wiki's for thier project, it seems seldom that people actually utilize them. They feel cold, impersonal, and lack the specific inputs that make an "issue index" friendly and usable.

### What is possible?
*But what do you do with that hard fought solution?* Do you keep this solution to yourself and move on? Tell a few people but then risk that solution fading from collective memory? If only there were some way to create a concise problem/solution index... an "issue index", that could be used as a collective repository for solutions to issues encountered in a particular project that could be referenced not only for this project, but for related projects in the future. This issue index would be inviting, simple, streamlined, and useful compared to unwelcoming wiki pages.

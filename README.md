## What is the Issue Index Application?

<br>

### What is the problem?
Suppose you are working on a project with a handful of engineers and you come across a problem. The problem (or as the application refers to it as an "issue") could be something complicated like a pesky bug, common errors, or anything in-between. And whether you solve the problem on your own, find a solution on stack overflow, ask a colleague, etc. you eventually find a solution. Unfortunately, in most cases you would most likely think nothing of it beyond it being a solution to the problem at hand and move on.

### Why hasnt the problem been solved?
Although services like github allow users to create wiki's for thier project, it seems seldom that people actually utilize them. They feel cold, impersonal, and lack the specific inputs that make an "issue index" friendly and usable.

### What is possible?
*But what do you do with that hard fought solution?* Do you keep this solution to yourself and move on? Tell a few people but then risk that solution fading from collective memory? If only there were some way to create a concise problem/solution index... an "issue index", that could be used as a collective repository for solutions to issues encountered in a particular project that could be referenced not only for this project, but for related projects in the future. This issue index would be inviting, simple, streamlined, and useful compared to unwelcoming wiki pages.

### What is different now?

## Project Name
Issue Index 

<br>

## Project Description
Issue Index is an index of open and closed issues encountered during a given project. With **Issue Index**, your team can navigate to a central hub to document any past, current, or even future issues with relative ease. Search by category through documented issues or browse thorough the most recent additions. Not sure about a specific category title? The search will accomodate partial spelling and inclusions. Have an issue that you want to post? Simply click "Add new issue", jot down the title of your issue, the problem and the solution, and/or even drag-and-drop a screen cap of your issue for future reference. You can even edit and delete issues if you want! This is a fully collaborative environment for your team.

## Who is this for?
**Developers** or any team members working on a common project with potentially common issues. This product is for teams that want to keep a lexicon of issues encountered in thier own development and used as a collective repository for solutions to issues encountered in a particular project that could be referenced not only for this project, but for related projects in the future. This issue index would be inviting, simple, streamlined, and useful compared to unwelcoming wiki pages.

## What are the application features?
The application has a main page with recents, categories, etc. From the main page, the user can search by category for given features. If the category does not exist, the user can create a category themselves. If the user wants to create an issue, they can create an issue with a title, a problem, and a possible solution, which are not required and can be left for others to contribute to at a later time.

## Who are the competitors and product inspriations?
Wiki's are a major inspiration for this project, such as wikipedia and even GitHub wiki's. However, those wikis seem to be impersonal and non-intuitive which is a major modus behind the functionality and layout of this Issue Index application.
